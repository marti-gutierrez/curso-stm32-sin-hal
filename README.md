# STM32 course without hall by *Wels theory*

In this repository, you'll find the program that will be seen during the course, in which peripherals and other systems will be added to **ARM Cortex-M3/M4** microcontrollers using the *C language and CMSIS*. In this case, I'll be using the **STM32F446RE** from the Nucleo-64 board.
